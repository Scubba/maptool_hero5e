# maptool_hero5e
Hero **5th edition** framework for MapTool

Drag and drop the `Lib/BvK 1.5.rptok` to any map/layer in MapTool.
- make sure the name is just `Lib:BvK`.  If the token is given a unique number, remove it.
- also make sure the token is 'Visible to Players'
- import the `Lib/BvK 1.5.mtprops` file to your campaign properties.
- although you can manually create character files, the best solution is to use https://github.com/Scubba/hdc_to_token to convert your HeroDesigner6 .hdc files
